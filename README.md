#Maven-oriented JSesh distributions. 
Contains the following folders and modules:


### Maven modules for JSesh

#### Libraries
* cupAndlex : a bundle with CUP and LEX. Probably usable for other projects as a maven MOJO.
* cupruntime : the CUP runtime, used by JSesh
* jsesh : the main jsesh library (we will remove the application part from it)
* jseshDoc : the module for JSesh documentation
* jseshGlyphs : the main hieroglyphic font
* jvect : vectorial copy/paste library.
* prepareJSeshRelease: a maven mojo for preparing the release (mostly indexing the fonts)
* utils : utilities to update some data files. nothing of interest.
* jhotdrawfw : the "application framework" part of JHOTDRAW 7.

Among those, the following modules are obsolete :
* jseshMac : the mac JSesh application (will be replaced by jseshAppli)
* jseshOthers : non-mac application jar (will be replaced by jseshAppli)

#### Softwares

* jseshAppli : a module containing
  the JSesh application (using JHotdraw)
* jsesh-installer : the IZ pack installer
* codeDumper : a small software to create a dump of JSesh files, 
  as simple lists of codes.


## Files and Folders not part of the general maven architecture

* README.md : this file
* TODO.md : ok, a TODO file
* comments: various text files I keep about JSesh, 
    and some unused code (unformal tests and 
    proof-of-concept)

## Working with eclipse:
there seems to be a problem with the eclipse plugin for maven regarding generated sources:
the "jsesh" maven module will report missing classes in eclipse.

A quick fix:

* import the JSesh-all project in eclipse (import maven project)
* open the jsesh module, and, on the pom.xml file, select "run as/maven package".
    This will create the missing files
* then, you need to add the corresponding folders to the jsesh eclipse project as "source folders".

    * In the jsesh module, open target/generated sources
	* Then right click on target/generated sources/cup, and select the menu entry "build path/use as source folder".
		do the same for the target/generated sources/lex folder.
		
That's it.

## Mac OS X distribution:

Bundled JRE for mac os X distribution need :

1) to patch flavormap.properties:
    add the line PDF: application/pdf (allows copy/paste of PDF)
    P.S. see if we can handle this as EMF ? (check if still needed anyway)

### Note about recent changes on Mac:

**Translocation** is certainly reasonable in some cases. For me, it's 
a (insert favorite rude word here)
idea which will force me to either
 integrate the sign editor in JSesh,
or double JSesh's size.
You can look at https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/app-translocation.html,

Moving the app itself though the finder removes the translocation problem...
but ... not moving a FOLDER which contains the app... Bored now.

Solution : make a package (.pkg) for instance with "Packages" by St√©phane Sudre.

## Windows distribution:
(TODO : explain how to create a window distribution,
 including an installer).
