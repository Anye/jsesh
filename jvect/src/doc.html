<h1 class="book-heading">Java Vector Cut and Paste Library</h1> 
<p>This is the home page for the Java Library JVectCutAndPaste. This library provides :</p> 
<ul> 
<li>writing support for a number of Vector formats (WMF, EMF, MacPict, EPS), which can be used with Graphics2D.</li> 
<li>a simple  class for copying vector images on the clipboard. Those images can be pasted in most word processors.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The java cut and paste library probably suffers from the <em>"good enough for me"</em> syndrom. That is, I did not try to support all graphic features (in particular as far as colour transparency and filling are concerned), but only those I needed. If you want more, feel free to contribute. So limitations are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>no transparency nor gradient fill. Just plain colour fill, which is reasonable for diagrams (or in my case for hieroglyphs).</li> 
<li>actual rendering depends on the target graphic format. EMF produces better results than MAC PICT or WMF, for instance (it can handle complex shapes with holes in them). As a rule, I prefer loosing some features than getting a bitmap (the solution chosen by java for printing).</li> 
<li>no support for bitmap pictures yet. This is probably not too difficult to add, and would be a good candidate for an external contribution.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Getting the source : you can download the latest version of the library with the command<br /> 
   <code>svn co https&#58;//jvect-clipboard.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jvect-clipboard/trunk/jvect-clipboard jvect-clipboard</code></p> 
<p>You can get the library and the sources from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jvect-clipboard/" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jvect-clipboard/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jvect-clipboard/</a><br /> 
(<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jvect-clipboard/files/" title="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jvect-clipboard/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/jvect-clipboard/files/</a>)</p> 
<p>Note that there are other libraries for vector graphics. If you need more complete capabilities, you might have a look at <a href="http://java.freehep.org/vectorgraphics/index.html">freeHep</a>. When I started the <a href="http://jsesh.qenherkhopeshef.org">JSesh</a> project, it didn't provide all functionnalities I needed, hence the creation of this library. Now, I haven't tried it yet, but the current version of FreeHep also provides clipboard capabilities (but it probably only works on Windows).</p> 
<h2>Trying it</h2> 
<p>Get the source distribution, and type "ant run".</p> 
<p>You will see a small window with a "copy" button. Click. Then open your favourite text editor (Word, OpenOffice, Mellel...).<br /> 
Type "paste", and lo, a nice red rectangle was pasted!</p> 
<h2>License and the like</h2> 
<p>This library is distributed under the LGPL (the GNU lesser public license), because I want it to be usable, including in commercial softwares.<br /> 
PDF copy/paste is done using an old version of IText, because of licenses issues (version 2.1.5 was still under the LGPL).</p> 
<h2>Using the library for creating vector graphics</h2> 
<p>The various Graphics2D object provided (for WMF, EMF, MACPICT, EPS, SVG...) are relatively easy to use. Please notice that I made them for a specific software, JSesh, which might mean they lack some features you need. In particular, I didn't bother to emulate transparency and the like.</p> 
<p>Currently, text is rendered as drawing outlines which means that :</p> 
<ol> 
<li>it will render reasonably well
<p>but</li> 
<li>the graphical file will be large, as the text is rendered as a drawing.</li> 
</ol> 
<h2>Pasting vector graphics</h2> 
<h3>Introduction</h3> 
<p>Vector graphics are often difficult to copy on the clipboard. In fact, on Windows, it used to be impossible without using native code, as one had to send the <em>address</em> of the vector graphics.</p> 
<p>This is why this system uses a trick (I'm not really sure how I decided to use it. I think a blog about Freemind gave me the idea. However, I haven't seen any free Java software which performed vector cut and paste (and on all platforms).</p> 
<p>The trick is that the vector graphic is embedded in RTF. And Java can copy RTF on the clipboard without any problem. That's the good news.</p> 
<p>Now, for the bad news:<br /> 
* RTF only support three formats: MACPICT, EMF and WMF. None of them support transparency, or CMYK colors.<br /> 
* RTF can be pasted without problem in a word processor. It works great with Word or Openoffice Writer. However, it doesn't work in PowerPoint, for instance.</p> 
<p>With recent versions of Java, things have improved, and some formats can be cut and pasted natively. For instance, PDF on Mac OS X, and EMF on Windows.</p> 
<h3>Simple case</h3> 
<p>You can have a look at <a href="http://jvect-clipboard.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jvect-clipboard/trunk/jvect-clipboard/test/JVectClipboardTest.java?view=markup">JVectClipboardTest</a> for a simple example.</p> 
<p>Basically, using the library is as simple as :</p> 
<p><div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp; // creating a SimpleGraphicsObject. The size is expressed in points.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SimpleClipGraphics clipGraphics = new SimpleClipGraphics(300, 200);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; // get the graphics object. The unit used is 1 unit = 1 point.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; Graphics2D g = clipGraphics.getGraphics();<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; // Draw...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; g.setColor(Color.RED);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; g.fill(new Rectangle2D.Double(30, 30, 100, 100));<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; // Dispose the graphics object...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; g.dispose();<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; // Send it to the clipboard<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; clipGraphics.copyToClipboard();</code></div></p> 
<p>And that's all.</p> 
<p>You might want to choose the format used for the embedded vector pictures. This is done by calling <code>setPictureFormat</code> <em>before</em> you call <code>getGraphics</code>. The default format used is MACPICT.</p> 
<p><div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SimpleClipGraphics clipGraphics = new SimpleClipGraphics(300, 200);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clipGraphics.setPictureFormat(PictureFormat.EMF);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graphics2D g = clipGraphics.getGraphics();</code></div></p> 
<p>How should you choose the format? Well:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>MACPICT: renders well <strong>on all platforms</strong>. The format is somehow limited (basically, it doesn't use curves, nor transparency, and coordinates are 16bits).</li> 
<li>WMF: renders well on windows, and more or less correctly on Mac OS X. The format is somehow limited (basically, it doesn't use curves, nor transparency, and coordinates are 16bits).</li> 
<li>EMF: gives great results with OpenOffice/Neooffice <strong>writer</strong> on all platforms. Renders well on M/S Windows with most word processors softwares. Doesn't render correctly on Mac OS X (except with OpenOffice/Neooffice).  The format is more or less equivalent to PS or PDF. It doesn't handle transparency.</li> 
<li>DIRECT_EMF: on Windows only. Has the advantage over embedded EMF that it is a real graphic format, not a trick using rich text. So it should work with most softwares, including those that don't understand RTF well enough (read : anything but word processors). So, DIRECT_EMF should work with powerpoint for instance.</li> 
<li>PDF: gives the best possible rendering, but only work with Mac OS X (and then, with the Mac OS X application which accept PDF copy/paste, for instance: mellel, Word 2008 (not Word 2004), and Apple softwares in general.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Of course, if you use curves in your drawing, you will get a reasonable approximation with MACPICT and WMF. But the EMF picture will be better.</p> 
<h3>More complex cases</h3> 
<p>In more complex cases, you want to propose a number of different formats on the clipboard.</p> 
<p>Then, the solution is usually to create your own Transferable class. This class will contain the original data which generates the picture, and propose it in various "flavors".</p> 
<p>Your code will be something like :</p> 
<p><div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public class MyTransferable implements Transferable {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static final DataFlavor RTF_FLAVOR = new DataFlavor(&quot;text/rtf&quot;, null);<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; private static final DataFlavor[] flavors= {RTF_FLAVOR, DataFlavor.stringFlavor};<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; private SomeObject objectToPaste;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><br />&nbsp; public RTFTransferable(RTFPicture rtfPicture) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this.rtfPicture= rtfPicture;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br /><br /> public Object getTransferData(DataFlavor flavor)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throws UnsupportedFlavorException, IOException {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (RTF_FLAVOR.equals(flavor)) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMFPicture pict= new EMFPicture(.....); // use the appropriate size for your data....<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Graphics2D g= pict.getGraphics();<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // draw on g what you want to draw...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g.dispose();<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return new ByteArrayInputStream(RTFPictureUtils<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .createRTFByteArray(pict));<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } else if (DataFlavor.stringFlavor.equals(flavor)) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return objectToPaste.toString();<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; } else {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; throw new UnsupportedFlavorException(flavor);<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />&nbsp; }<br /><br /> public DataFlavor[] getTransferDataFlavors() {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return flavors;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br /><br /> public boolean isDataFlavorSupported(DataFlavor flavor) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DataFlavor[] flavors = getTransferDataFlavors();<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for (int i = 0; i &lt; flavors.length; i++) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if (flavors[i].equals(flavor)) {<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return true;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return false;<br />&nbsp; }<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }</code></div></p> 
<p>Of course, this is simply a technical example. I suggest to isolate the drawing code in another class.</p> 
<h3>Not using the library</h3> 
<p>If your target is a Mac, you might consider pasting PDF on the clipboard. PDF works great with most "real" Mac softwares, like Mellel. Word 2008 also support PDF (which is a good move). Now, of course, embedded PDF will be somehow problematic if you want to share your file with someone running windows. You can use IText to produce PDF.</p> 
<p>To do this, you need to create a Transferable object which handle the PDF flavour. The DataFlavor to use is:<br /> 
<div class="codeblock"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; public static final DataFlavor PDFFlavor = new DataFlavor(<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &quot;application/pdf&quot;, null); </code></div></p> 
<p>I might write a longer explanation later, with a short example. If you are interested, you may look at the JSesh code.</p> 
<h2>A useful utility</h2> 
<p>If you need to experiment and try to see what java can copy or paste, I have writen for my own tests a small class called<br /> 
 <a href="http://jvect-clipboard.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jvect-clipboard/trunk/jvect-clipboard/test/TransfertTest.java?view=markup">TransfertTest</a></p> 
<p>It's stand-alone. Just get and compile. It allows you to inspect the clipboard, and try to copy or paste stuff.</p>
