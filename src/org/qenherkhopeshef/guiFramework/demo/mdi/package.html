        <h1>Multiple document framework</h1>
        This part of the Qenherkhopeshef framework is dedicated to multiple document
        applications. We test it with a simple document system, i.e. basically a text.
        Note that we actually use a <em>multiple windows interface.</em>

        The demo includes a number of likely features in a software:
        <ul>
            <li> a palette/tool system </li>
            <li> a task/swingworker interface (the text loading process being artificially slow to demonstrate
                its use)
            </li>
            <li> a system-aware interface: Mac will get a different behaviour and different
                menus.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Architectural notes</h2>
        <p>About menus: A menubar can apparently be linked with only <em>one</em>
            Frame. As we want to have multiple frames (especially for the mac), it means that
            each frame must have a menu. Considering the mac, this menu is attached to any
            frame, as the Mac menu is in fact the application menu, not the individual frames'.
            So, for instance, a dialog frame should have a menu (at least on the mac), which
        allows to open new documents and the like.</p>

        <p> Hence: there needs to be one menu per JFrame. This menu must access both the
            document edited in the JFrame <em>and</em> the general application.
        </p>
