<body>
	The main JSesh application. Used to be a first attempt for a new, better structured version.
	<p>Not used (kept for reuse of some parts). There are at least two application framework already available (jhotdraw and the one in antlrworks) and we don't have the time to reinvent the wheel</p>
	<p> Currently not used. 
	<p> The application is still built "by hand", as we wait for an "official" action framework.
	
	<p> As for the actual architecture, the idea is the following:
	<ul>
	<li> the application creates everything.
	<li> the application workflow is a mediator for the graphic UI, and communicates 
	data between the various graphical windows
	<li> the user interface is built on an abstract view of the application, which it should use. 
	</ul>
