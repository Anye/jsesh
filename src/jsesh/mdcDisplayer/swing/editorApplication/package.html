	The main JSesh application. First attempt for a new, better structured version.
	<p> Currently not used. 
	<p> The application is still built "by hand", as we wait for an "official" action framework.
	
	<p> As for the actual architecture, the idea is the following:
	<ul>
	<li> the application creates everything.
	<li> the application workflow is a mediator for the graphic UI, and communicates 
	data between the various graphical windows
	<li> the user interface is built on an abstract view of the application, which it should use. 
	</ul>
